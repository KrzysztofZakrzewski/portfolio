# Hello and welcome to my portfolio.

## It is About:
This section contains exploratory data analyses (EDA), Python projects, applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, as well as small-scale applications.

## About me:
I’m passionate about exploring the world of data and technology, constantly seeking new knowledge and inspiration. As an aspiring Data Scientist, I enjoy uncovering stories hidden within data through analysis and statistics.

I’m proficient in Python and key data science libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. I regularly work with tools such as Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda, and VSCode to build and test solutions efficiently. Additionally, I’m taking my first steps in Linux, expanding my technical toolkit.

Problem-solving and learning new technologies feel like solving puzzles to me — all it takes is a text editor, a jupyter notebook, and curiosity.
