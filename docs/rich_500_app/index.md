# the_500_richest – application based on a previous analysis

I decided to revisit and refresh one of my older codebases.
It is a simple application used to present data from a previous analysis:

<a href="https://krzysztofzakrzewski.github.io/portfolio/rich_500/">rich_500</a>.

### The analysis itself is not the main focus of this presentation — the refactoring process is.

This is also the first application I have deployed to a production environment on my own server (Raspberry Pi 5 running Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS), using Docker and Cloudflare.

### Refactoring Assumptions:

- Refactored a monolithic application (1,793 lines in a single file with heavy if/else logic) into a modular structure.

- Reduced the main application file to ~60 lines by extracting responsibilities into separate modules.

- Introduced 12 new files to improve separation of concerns and maintainability.

- Although the total line count increased to ~1,865 lines, a significant portion consists of comments, spacing, and documentation.

- The effective amount of executable code was reduced to approximately 1,000 lines, with further optimization still possible.

- The resulting code base is much more readable, easier to maintain and extend than before. 😄

All changes were implemented based on the original dataset without altering their values or substantive content.

The changes included:

Converting numeric values written in shorthand (e.g., "447B") into readable numeric formats to facilitate calculations and readability.

Removing unnecessary spaces from column names to simplify work.

No DataFrame altered the original values.
