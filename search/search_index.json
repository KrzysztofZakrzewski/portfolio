As an aspiring Data Scientist, I enjoy uncovering stories hidden within data through analysis and statistics.</p> <p>I\u2019m proficient in Python and key data science libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. I regularly work with tools such as Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda, and VSCode to build and test solutions efficiently. Additionally, I\u2019m taking my first steps in Linux, expanding my technical toolkit.</p> <p>Problem-solving and learning new technologies feel like solving puzzles to me \u2014 all it takes is a text editor, a jupyter notebook, and curiosity.</p>"},{"location":"W_przygotowaniau/","title":"Next projects will appear soon. \u270d\ud83c\udffb","text":""},{"location":"iris/","title":"Data Analysis EDA of Irises: Domain Exploration","text":"<p>Welcome to explore my project on a classic exploratory data analysis (EDA) topic \u2014 the irises.

The data pertains to the year 2024.</p> <p>The purpose of this analysis was not just curiosity about how the richest people get wealthy. Honestly, I care little about that. The goals outlined in the analysis may seem fairly standard, but they can prompt some reflection. The sums presented in the analysis are extremely unbelievable, even absurd.</p> <p>This can provoke thought. In my opinion, money is a certain kind of driving force, and the amounts shown here are simply incredible. Let\u2019s start with an observation that not everyone might realize:</p> <p>1,000,000 seconds equals approximately 11.57 days. 1,000,000,000 seconds is roughly 31 years and 8.5 months!!!</p> <p>While I can roughly predict what I\u2019ll be doing in two weeks down to the minute, predicting what I\u2019ll be doing in 31 years\u2026 I can only hope that I\u2019ll still be healthy, young, wealthy, and living my life in a certain way\u2014e.g., training on a mook yan jong. \ud83d\ude0a</p> <p>While I can imagine the legendary \u201cfirst million,\u201d the \u201cfirst billion\u201d is quite abstract. It\u2019s not a house with a backyard and a car. It\u2019s infrastructure and ecosystem. It\u2019s on a completely different scale.</p> <p>Regarding the regions, the original dataset did not meet my expectations. Division into individual countries was too detailed, while a simple division into continents seemed incomplete. It did not give full control over the data.</p> <p>I divided the countries not only into continents but also into China and India, because, in my opinion, these countries are not only huge, but in their vastness they also represent separate cultures and ecosystems. In China alone, according to the dataset, the number of billionaires is almost equal to the rest of Asia, while in India it is about half compared to China or Asia. You could divide both of these large countries into districts, but they are still vast national agglomerations, in a sense even civilizational. Their populations can already be counted in billions.</p> <p>I am providing both the original dataset and the version modified by me for analysis. As we can observe, some of the values presented in the data are extreme.</p> <p>Created 20.08.2025 </p> <p>Download Notebook Dowland Dataset</p> <p>Author of orginal dataset:</p> <p>Dowland Orginal Dataset Author of dataset</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"titanic/","title":"Data Analysis EDA related to the Titanic disaster: Domain Exploration","text":"<p>Welcome to explore my second project of exploratory data analysis (EDA) related to the Titanic disaster.
